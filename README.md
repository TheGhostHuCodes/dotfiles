#dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for vim and git.

##Prerequisites

###Esc
The Esc key on most modern keyboards are ridiculously small. The best way I
have found to solve this problem is to remap the Caps Lock key to be a second Esc

- In Ubuntu, I use gnome-tweak-tool
```
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
```

- In Windows, I use [SharpKeys](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/)

###Vim Package Manager
My current package manager of choice is [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
